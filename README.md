# PSE-Utility-Outage-Scraper

Puget Sound Energy Utility Outage Scraper is a very simple scraping application that extracts from a JSON feed to the Puget Sound Energy outage map all the current outages.  For my particular use, I am running it on a Raspberry Pi 3 at 5 minute intervals on Maria DB, but I also wrapped up a version for SQL Sever too.

--Updates to be added later with instructions and further documentation.
